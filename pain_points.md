# Python Pain Points

1. Clumsy lambda syntax:
    - No multiline lambda and no intermediate variables.
1. Pipe-forward style:
    - How many times have you ever needed to do list(.)?
1. Currying
1. Iterator chaining:
    - Cannot be done in a straightforward manner in Python
1. Pattern matching functions:
    - We only need the head, tail decomposition
1. Bonuses:
    - Assignment functions: no more returns
    - Builtin higher-order functions
    - Pet peeve: one letter -> one-line scope
    - Declarative instead of imperative

# Coconut Pain Points

1. Cannot slice filter
1. Reiterable needs to be defined manually
